# Oral Hygiene

Oral health is a critical component of Bryan Johnson's evening routine. A healthy mouth is not only essential for aesthetics but also plays a vital role in overall health.

## Steps

1. **Brushing**: Bryan starts by brushing his teeth using a fluoride toothpaste to remove food particles and prevent plaque buildup.

2. **Flossing**: Flossing helps remove food particles and plaque from between the teeth and below the gumline, areas a toothbrush can't reach.

3. **Mouthwash**: Using a mouthwash can help kill bacteria, freshen breath, and provide added protection against cavities and gum disease.

4. **Tongue Cleaning**: Cleaning the tongue can help remove bacteria and freshen breath. Bryan uses a tongue scraper for this purpose.

5. **Specialized Treatments**: Depending on his needs, Bryan might use specialized treatments like whitening strips or trays, or even a bruxism device if he experiences teeth grinding.

By maintaining a thorough oral hygiene routine, Bryan ensures his mouth remains healthy, reducing the risk of dental issues and contributing to his overall well-being.
