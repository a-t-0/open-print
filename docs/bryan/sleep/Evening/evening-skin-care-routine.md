# Skin Routine

Bryan Johnson places a significant emphasis on skin health, recognizing it as a reflection of overall well-being and an essential component of his anti-aging protocol. His skin routine is designed to nourish, protect, and rejuvenate the skin, ensuring it remains healthy and vibrant.

## Steps

1. **Cleansing**: Bryan starts by cleansing his face to remove any impurities, dirt, or residual makeup. This step ensures that the skin is clean and ready to absorb the subsequent products.

2. **Exfoliation**: Periodic exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover and revealing fresher, younger-looking skin.

3. **Toning**: A toner helps balance the skin's pH levels and prepares the skin for the next steps in the routine.

4. **Serums**: Bryan applies serums that are rich in active ingredients targeting specific skin concerns. These can range from anti-aging to hydration or even skin brightening.

5. **Moisturizing**: A good moisturizer ensures that the skin remains hydrated, locking in the benefits of the previous steps and preventing dryness or flakiness.

6. **Eye Cream**: The skin around the eyes is delicate and often shows the first signs of aging. Bryan uses an eye cream to address concerns like fine lines, puffiness, or dark circles.

7. **Special Treatments**: Depending on his skin's needs, Bryan might incorporate special treatments like masks, spot treatments, or even tools like facial rollers or gua sha.

8. **Protection**: If he's expecting to be exposed to any environmental factors, Bryan ensures he uses products that offer protection, such as antioxidants or even sunscreen during the day.

By following this structured skin routine, Bryan ensures that his skin remains in optimal health, reflecting the care and attention he gives to his overall well-being.
