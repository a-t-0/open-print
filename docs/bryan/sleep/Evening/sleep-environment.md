# Sleep Environment

Creating the perfect environment for sleep is a cornerstone of Bryan Johnson's evening routine. The surroundings play a significant role in determining sleep quality.

## Steps

1. **Room Temperature**: Bryan ensures his bedroom is at an optimal temperature, typically cooler, as it promotes better sleep. Bryan sets his room temperature to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. **Darkness**: A dark environment is crucial for sleep. Bryan uses blackout curtains and ensures all light sources, including electronic devices, are turned off or covered.

3. **Noise Control**: A quiet environment is essential. Bryan uses earplugs to ensure minimal disturbances.

4. **Bedding**: Using comfortable and breathable bedding can make a significant difference. Bryan opts for materials that regulate temperature and provide adequate support.

5. **Air Quality**: Ensuring the room has clean air is essential. Bryan might use air purifiers or even plants known to purify the air.

6. **Electronics**: Bryan minimizes the use of electronics in the bedroom, understanding that they can interfere with sleep due to blue light emission.

By crafting the perfect sleep environment, Bryan sets the stage for a night of restful and rejuvenating sleep.
