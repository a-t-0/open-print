When beginning the supplementation journey, it can be overwhelming to decide where to start. Bryan has a list of "starter items" that he recommends for those new to this protocol. These are foundational supplements that provide a broad range of benefits and are a good starting point for anyone looking to enhance their health.

Here are some of the starter items:

- **Multivitamin**: A comprehensive multivitamin to cover any potential nutrient gaps in the diet.
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Essential for brain health and reducing inflammation.
- **Vitamin D**: Important for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.
- **Probiotics**: Beneficial for gut health and digestion.
- **Magnesium**: Supports muscle function, energy production, and nervous system health.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplementation regimen. This ensures that the supplements are suitable for your individual needs and won't interact negatively with any medications you might be taking.
