# Super Veggie

A wholesome meal rich in vegetables, seeds, and flavors.

## Ingredients

- Black lentils, 45 grams dry, ~150 grams cooked
- Broccoli (head+stalk), 250 grams
- Cauliflower, 150 grams
- Shiitake or Maitake Mushrooms, 50 grams
- Garlic, 1 clove
- Ginger Root, 3 grams
- Lime, 1
- Cumin, 1 Tbsp
- Apple Cider Vinegar, 1 Tbsp
- Hemp Seeds, 1 Tbsp
- After prep, drizzle 1 Tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- Optional: sprinkle 1 Tbsp of 100% dark chocolate to the dish (All ingredients are recommended to be organic)

## Preparation Instructions

1. Weigh Vegetables: Start by weighing out the required amounts of broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, ginger, and garlic.
1. Boil Vegetables: Place the broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms (either maitake or shiitake), ginger, and garlic in boiling water. Boil until they are tender, which should take about 7-9 minutes. Steaming is also an acceptable method.
1. Cook Lentils: In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the black lentils and reduce the heat to low. Cook them uncovered for about 18-20 minutes until they are "al dente". After cooking, place the lentils in a colander to drain and rinse them under cold water.
1. Blend Ingredients: You can choose to blend the ingredients or keep them as whole pieces. If blending, place 1 Tbsp of dried cumin, 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar, 1 fresh lime, the cooked black lentils, and the strained cooked vegetables into a high-speed blender. Blend the mixture until it becomes a thick soup consistency. If needed, you can add some of the vegetable water (or steaming water) to adjust the texture.
1. Final Touches: Once blended, top the mixture with hemp seeds. If prepared correctly, the taste should resemble a smooth-tasting veggie hummus without a strong garlic flavor. Bryan Johnson recommends seasoning it with NuSalt (potassium chloride) for taste.
